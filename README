List all enabled hosts:

while read shortname hostname type enab username pass enabpass; do
  # whaterver you need
  echo "Hit host: $hostname"
done <<EOF
$(./rat-list -p)
EOF

Connect to the host and run command:

./rat-com -c "show version" shortname
./rat-com -c "show version" hostname.domain.tld

Connect to the host and start interactive session:

./rat-com shortname
./rat-com hostname.domain.tld

Of course you can provide you own host defition (username, passwords, ...) on
the command line. Please see ./rat-com --help for details.
