Router Administration Toolkit

Simple toolkit for connecting and issuing commands or interacting with
various network devices over SSH or any other text interface.

There are two distinct interfaces:
 * Python object interface
 * Command line interface

Supported devices so far:
 * Cisco IOS (tested: 12.2, 15.0, 15.2)
 * HP ProCurve switches (tested: 2610 + 2810 series)

Interactions:
 * Python interface:
   TODO
 * Bash:

List all enabled hosts:

while read shortname hostname type enab username pass enabpass; do
  # whaterver you need
  echo "Hit host: $hn"
done <<EOF
$(./rat-list -p)
EOF

Connect to the host and run command:

./rat-com -c "show version" shortname
./rat-com -c "show version" hostname.domain.tld

Connect to the host and start interactive session:

./rat-com shortname
./rat-com hostname.domain.tld

Of course you can provide you own host defition (username, passwords, ...) on
the command line. Please see ./rat-com --help for details.
